🌾 Kerala Farm Assistant App | Android (Java)

I developed an Android-based “Kerala Farm Assistant” application aimed at empowering farmers through smart technology and real-time support.

🔹 Key Features:

🌿 Crop Disease Detection to identify plant health issues early

🤝 NGO Connectivity for farmer support and guidance

🌦️ Real-time Weather Monitoring to support better farming decisions

🚨 Alert System for critical updates and notifications

🏛️ Government Scheme Information to ensure farmers don’t miss benefits

This application was successfully published and presented in a Hackathon, where it received positive feedback for its social impact, usability, and practical approach to solving real-world agricultural problems.

💡 Built using Java for Android, the app focuses on accessibility, reliability, and farmer-friendly design
